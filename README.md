The project is being developed under e-Yantra Summer Internship Program 2020, a joint initiative by IIT Bombay and MHRD.

# Abstract:
The objective of the game is to spread the awareness about defensive measures for the virus in a playful way.

● Here the health worker tries to contain the spread of corona in a neighbourhood inhabited by NPC’s.

● Timer  - Timer is constantly running

● NPC Behaviour - NPC’s can randomly move between adjacent houses.

At the start of the game, 1 or more NPCs are infected by virus. (But we don’t know which).
NPC movement across houses will lead to spread of disease.
